CSUN Computer Science Senior Design Project (COMP 490-491)

### About our game 
**DMCIVG** stands for, **"Dynamic Music Composition in Video Games."** The goal of our project is to create a game which composes music in real-time. The music in our game adapts to events and changes in the game's state to create a unique auditory experience on every playthrough.  

Our project uses the audio processing software and visual programming language, [Pure Data.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data) The game was made using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine.

### ---***Important***--- How to play our game:
**Always** make sure to open the Pure Data patch (Sequencer.pd) in Pure Data **before** launching the game. 

**Also**, make sure you only have **one copy** of Sequencer.pd running in Pure Data when you play the game.  

If you don't already have the Pure Data program on your computer, **download it** [here](https://puredata.info/downloads). Our project is currrently running on release 0.51-1 of the "vanilla" distribution of Pure Data (without extensions).
